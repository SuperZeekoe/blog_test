## Blog assignment

The assignment is to create a blog website including a content management system with Express, SQLite3 and NodeJS.

### Added improvements

Added remove function, category filtering and image addition function.

### Use guide

Click on 'Create New Post' to move to the post creation page. Upon arrival enter your desired title, content and add an image if you like.
Then press 'Submit' to submit your post.

You'll be redirected to the homepage from here. Upon arrival you can use the 'Remove' button to remove a post from the page, or click the filter options up top
to filter existing posts.

### What I've learned.

This is the first time fully using Express and SQLite3. Working with databases is something quite new, especially the SQLite3 part.
Routing everything is something I'm going to have to get used to, but it seems reasonably easy to understand.

Also the category filtering is something that's new. It goes through express router. It requires a bit more understanding but when I continue working with it
I'm sure it'll become second nature.

### Next Steps

The next phase involves further upgrading and updating the blog, including the addition of a login function and hosting the website online. The feedback received has been invaluable, shaping the website's development and enhancing its overall appeal.
